# CRS A255 controller

## My Covid-19 lock-down project:  Building a motion and motor controller for a 5-axis industrial robot.

Why?  Well, why not?  I had a CRS A255 robot arm for some years and always wanted more flexibility in the controller and itâ€™s a good challenge to design everything from scratch.
